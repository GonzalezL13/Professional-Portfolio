Week 2's challenge was to create a professional portfolio. 
I created links to different parts of the page. As well as added a profile picture to my page.
In the middle of the page there is a grid containers with projects. By clicking on them it will take you to the application. 
I did put placeholders on a few of them. The project also has hover effects on the grid container and the contact section.


The link to my github is : https://github.com/GonzalezL13/Professional-Portfolio.git

the link to my deployed app is : https://gonzalezl13.github.io/Professional-Portfolio/
